<p>You haven&rsquo;t broken free yet. You haven&rsquo;t <em>really</em> tried, but it doesn&rsquo;t work like you think it does either. Kicking down barriers, busting through the wall, and running into a the sun will feel great. But once the liberation glow wears off you&rsquo;re just in an an empty field, having to build from scratch, alone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say you won&rsquo;t have adventures with storybook endings. You will taste a kind of freedom, a freedom from having to &ldquo;be&rdquo; anything. You&rsquo;ll travel and learn and you&rsquo;ll never stop being curious. But you can&rsquo;t live off this kind of freedom forever, all intake and no output. It&rsquo;s hedonistic, selfish and ultimately unfulfilling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortcut, no high that will carry you through the entire journey. There is no &ldquo;turn a corner and figure it all out.&rdquo; The real &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; is to take the N+1 step. You won&rsquo;t quit because it&rsquo;s hard, you won&rsquo;t kill it because you proved it was a bad idea, you&rsquo;ll just get bored and distracted: <strong>idea purgatory</strong>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a genius, you&rsquo;re not special, you&rsquo;re not exempt. You&rsquo;ll have to put in the work like everyone else. One goddamn foot in front of the other, every day, until you&rsquo;re not where you were. Then maybe you&rsquo;ll be free.</p>
